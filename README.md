## Blog Application built using:
## React, Graphql, Apollo Client, Apollo Server, Express, Prisma and PostgreSQL.

### Purpose of this project:

- I really wanted to learn Apollo Server.
- I also wanted to keep practicing the use of Apollo Client Hooks `useQuery` and `useMutation`.
- I wanted to use MongoDB with Prisma but I was not able to deploy the supplied Docker image successfully. I decided to go with Prisma's one-click-integration with PostgreSQL.
